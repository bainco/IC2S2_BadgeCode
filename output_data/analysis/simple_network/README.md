## README
This only uses data from consenting participant badges. There is no server badge
data in this file (except for the entries that Participant badges recoreded
   when they checked in.)

The file pdata-all.csv is the file used to generate all_to_all.csv. The former
is the old file format that included weird headers. The latter is literally just
a list of interactions in the form <badgeID, badgeID> for each line.

Note that all server badges have ids in the 2000s
          all part badges have ids in the 1000s
